Dear user this was added before the rest/n

I am writing to express my deep dissatisfaction regarding the issue of excessively loud televisions in public spaces within Belfast city. As a resident, I find it increasingly difficult to appreciate the ambience and tranquillity that these public areas should ideally offer. The obnoxious volume of the televisions not only disturbs my peace but also creates an environment where civil conversations are rendered impossible.
I have previously tried reaching out to Belfast City Council in order to address this issue, however, it appears as though my concerns have fallen on deaf ears, as I have not received any response from the council. This lack of acknowledgement and action is disheartening and only serves to further frustrate me.
In light of this situation, I would like to kindly request that Belfast City Council takes immediate and necessary steps to regulate the volume levels of televisions in public spaces. This should be done not only for the sake of those who wish to enjoy some semblance of peace but also for maintaining a conducive environment where people can engage in meaningful conversations without having to shout over blaring television sets.
Please consider my plea and take appropriate action at your earliest convenience. Thank you for your attention to this matter.
